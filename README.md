Guessing Colours Mind Game

A colour-based guessing mind game where you compete against the AI HAL-9000 in a fun mix of chance, strategy, and psychology. Each round, both players choose a colour and guess their opponent’s choice. Earn points for correct guesses and bonus points on special rounds. The AI adapts its behaviour based on the chosen difficulty level, making the game progressively more challenging.
